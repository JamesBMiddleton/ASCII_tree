## ASCII_tree 

ASCII_tree uses procedural generation to produce coloured tree-like structures in a terminal window using ASCII characters. <br>

Inspired by [cbonsai](https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/cbonsai).

### Requirements

Must be run in a terminal emulator that supports **ANSI escape codes** and **24 bit colour**. <br>

_Supported_ - Konsole (KDE), Xterm, Iterm (MacOS), libvte based terminals (GNOME, Xfce)  <br>
_Unsupported_ - Windows CMD, Powershell (unless you manually enable 24bit colour)

### Installation & Usage
ASCII_tree has no external dependencies, just compile and run! <br>

Add the argument "--seed 123" to use a specific random seed.
